### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**HajarSadek/HajarSadek** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: the Project Workshop Series which is going to enable data science club members to create their own projects and portfolios
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: GANs
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: cool projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: DeepFakes, there's a project idea I'd like to pursue that uses deepfakes to for sport coaching
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an Archer! It's objectively the best sport ever! :D
